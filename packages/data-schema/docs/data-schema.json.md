## Json type

INTERNAL: This type is exported to allow users to compile declaration (\*.d.ts) files. Direct use of this type may result in changes that break you build across minor versions.

A precise, recursive Json type blows the type calculation stack without installing explicit `Json extends T ? short-circuit : ...` type checks all over the place. We may take that on later. But, this is a good-enough approximation for now.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type Json = null | string | number | boolean | object | any[];
```
