## a.manyToMany() function

Create a many-to-many relationship between two models with the manyToMany() method. Provide a common relationName on both models to join them into a many-to-many relationship. Under the hood a many-to-many relationship is modeled with a "join table" with corresponding `hasMany()` relationships between the two related models. You must set the same `manyToMany()` field on both models of the relationship.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare function manyToMany<RM extends string, RN extends string>(relatedModel: RM, opts: {
    relationName: RN;
}): ModelRelationalField<ModelRelationalTypeArgFactory<RM, ModelRelationshipTypes.manyToMany, true, RN>, RM, "required", undefined>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  relatedModel | RM | name of the related model |
|  opts | { relationName: RN; } | pass in the <code>relationName</code> that will serve as the join table name for this many-to-many relationship |

**Returns:**

ModelRelationalField&lt;ModelRelationalTypeArgFactory&lt;RM, ModelRelationshipTypes.manyToMany, true, RN&gt;, RM, "required", undefined&gt;

a many-to-many relationship definition
