## \_Internal\_Json type

\# INTERNAL

Not intended to be consumed directly, as naming and factoring is subject to change.

A precise, recursive Json type blows the type calculation stack without installing explicit `Json extends T ? short-circuit : ...` type checks all over the place. We may take that on later. But, this is a good-enough approximation for now.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type _Internal_Json = null | string | number | boolean | object | any[];
```
