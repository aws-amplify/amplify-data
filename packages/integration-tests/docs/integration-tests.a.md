## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [belongsTo(relatedModel)](./integration-tests.a.belongsto.md) | Make a <code>hasOne()</code> or <code>hasMany()</code> relationship bi-directional using the <code>belongsTo()</code> method. The belongsTo() method requires that a hasOne() or hasMany() relationship already exists from parent to the related model. |
|  [boolean()](./integration-tests.a.boolean.md) | A boolean scalar type that can be either true or false. |
|  [combine(schemas)](./integration-tests.a.combine.md) | The interface for merging up to 50 schemas into a single API. |
|  [customType(fields)](./integration-tests.a.customtype.md) |  |
|  [date()](./integration-tests.a.date.md) | A date scalar type that is represented server-side as an extended ISO 8601 date string in the format <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>. |
|  [datetime()](./integration-tests.a.datetime.md) | A date time scalar type that is represented server-side as an extended ISO 8601 date and time string in the format <code>YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ</code>. |
|  [email()](./integration-tests.a.email.md) | An email scalar type that is represented server-side in the format <code>local-part@domain-part</code> as defined by RFC 822. |
|  [enum(values)](./integration-tests.a.enum.md) | this type param pattern allows us to infer literal type values from the array without using the <code>as const</code> suffix |
|  [float()](./integration-tests.a.float.md) | A float scalar type following represented server-side as an IEEE 754 floating point value. |
|  [hasMany(relatedModel)](./integration-tests.a.hasmany.md) | Create a one-directional one-to-many relationship between two models using the <code>hasMany()</code> method. |
|  [hasOne(relatedModel)](./integration-tests.a.hasone.md) | Create a one-directional one-to-one relationship between two models using the <code>hasOne(&quot;MODEL_NAME&quot;)</code> method. A hasOne relationship always uses a reference to the related model's identifier. Typically this is the <code>id</code> field unless overwritten with the <code>identifier()</code> method. |
|  [id()](./integration-tests.a.id.md) | A unique identifier scalar type. This scalar is serialized like a String but isn't meant to be human-readable. If not specified on create operations, a ULID will be auto-generated service-side. |
|  [integer()](./integration-tests.a.integer.md) | An integer scalar type with a supported value range between -(2^31) and 2^31-1. |
|  [ipAddress()](./integration-tests.a.ipaddress.md) | A valid IPv4 or IPv6 address scalar type. IPv4 addresses are expected in quad-dotted notation (123.12.34.56). IPv6 addresses are expected in non-bracketed, colon-separated format (1a2b:3c4b:ðŸ”¢4567). You can include an optional CIDR suffix (123.45.67.89/16) to indicate subnet mask. |
|  [json()](./integration-tests.a.json.md) | A JSON scalar type that is automatically parsed and loaded server-side as maps, lists, or scalar values rather than as the literal input strings. |
|  [manyToMany(relatedModel, opts)](./integration-tests.a.manytomany.md) | Create a many-to-many relationship between two models with the manyToMany() method. Provide a common relationName on both models to join them into a many-to-many relationship. Under the hood a many-to-many relationship is modeled with a "join table" with corresponding <code>hasMany()</code> relationships between the two related models. You must set the same <code>manyToMany()</code> field on both models of the relationship. |
|  [model(fields)](./integration-tests.a.model.md) | A data model that creates a matching Amazon DynamoDB table and provides create, read (list and get), update, delete, and subscription APIs. |
|  [mutation()](./integration-tests.a.mutation.md) |  |
|  [phone()](./integration-tests.a.phone.md) | A phone number scalar type thas is stored as a string server-side. Phone numbers can contain either spaces or hyphens to separate digit groups. Phone numbers without a country code are assumed to be US/North American numbers adhering to the North American Numbering Plan. |
|  [query()](./integration-tests.a.query.md) |  |
|  [ref(link)](./integration-tests.a.ref.md) |  |
|  [schema(types)](./integration-tests.a.schema.md) | The API and data model definition for Amplify Data. Pass in <code>{ &lt;NAME&gt;: a.model(...) }</code> to create a database table and exposes CRUDL operations via an API. |
|  [string()](./integration-tests.a.string.md) | A string scalar type that is represented server-side as a UTF-8 character sequence. |
|  [subscription()](./integration-tests.a.subscription.md) |  |
|  [time()](./integration-tests.a.time.md) | A time scalar type that is represented server-side as an extended ISO 8601 time string in the format <code>hh:mm:ss.sss</code>. |
|  [timestamp()](./integration-tests.a.timestamp.md) | A timestamp scalar type that is represented by an integer value of the number of seconds before or after <code>1970-01-01-T00:00Z</code>. |
|  [url()](./integration-tests.a.url.md) | A URL scalar type as defined by RFC 1738. For example, https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NZW3KC/ or mailto:example<!-- -->@<!-- -->example.com. URLs must contain a schema (http, mailto) and can't contain two forward slashes (//) in the path part. |

## Variables

|  Variable | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [allow](./integration-tests.a.allow.md) | Defines an authorization rule for your data models and fields. First choose an authorization strategy (<code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>owner</code>, <code>group</code>, or <code>custom</code>), then choose an auth provider (<code>apiKey</code>, <code>iam</code>, <code>userPools</code>, <code>oidc</code>, or <code>function</code>) and optionally use <code>.to(...)</code> to specify the operations that can be performed against your data models and fields. |
|  [handler](./integration-tests.a.handler.md) |  |
