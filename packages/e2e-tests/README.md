# WIP E2E samples

This package contains automated tests that share a single Node app for validating 
our functionality E2E.

## WIP Notes:
- `tsx`
    - primary testing happens here.
- `amplify-next-pages-template`
    - a fork of the repo used in our Getting Started docs, uses Next.
- `vite-node-e2e-sample` 
    - uses `vite-node` to compile.
    - potential path for test a Vite config file, but without other Cypress, etc.
