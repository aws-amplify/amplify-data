## BackendSecret type

Importing the full objects from @<!-- -->aws-amplify/plugin-types more than doubles dev env runtime. This type replacement will contain the content for config without the negative side-effects. We may need to re-approach if customers interact with these programmatically to avoid forcing narrowing.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type BackendSecret = {
    resolve: (scope: any, backendIdentifier: any) => any;
    resolvePath: (backendIdentifier: any) => any;
};
```
