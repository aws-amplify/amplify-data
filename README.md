# AWS Amplify Data Schema Builder

This repository contains the implementation for the Amplify Data Schema Builder package `@aws-amplify/data-schema`, the Amplify Data Client `generateClient()`, as well as supporting utilities, automated tests, and performance benchmarks.

These packages are dependencies of `@aws-amplify/backend` and `aws-amplify` (Amplify JS). _They are not intended to be installed and used directly._
